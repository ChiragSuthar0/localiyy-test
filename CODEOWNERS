# This is a comment

## Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners

## These owners will be the default owners for everything in

## the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence

## @ChiragSuthar0 will be requested for

## review when someone opens a pull request

* @ChiragSuthar0

## Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most

## precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only

## modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global

## owner(s) will be requested for a review
